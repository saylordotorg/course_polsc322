**Unit 1: The Impact of Religion and Philosophy on the Governance of
Southeast and Northeast Asia** <span id="1"></span> 
*In this unit, you will review the fundamental tenets of five religions
that have influenced Asian philosophy, culture, and politics.  An
understanding of these religions is essential to gaining perspective on
the issues that have impacted the region in the past and present.  Each
of these religions tends to be more collectivist in their approach than
the Judeo-Christian tradition, and many political scientists see this as
an explanation for the types of governments that have existed in Asia
from ancient times to the present. *  
 *             
 Confucianism gained adherents primarily in China and the Koreas, giving
rise to “Kung Fu.” Shinto was founded in Japan, giving rise to samurai
culture and imbuing Japanese emperors and their families with the status
of deities for centuries, up to the end of World War II.  Taoism (also
called “Daoism,” depending on the system of transliter-ation used)
focuses on the interconnectivity of man with one another and with
nature; it has some common elements with Buddhism, but is more of a
philosophy than what we often think of as an organized religion.
Buddhism began in India, and migrated eastward, claiming adherents
throughout Asia. Islam began in Saudi Arabia and migrated both East and
West, becoming popular throughout Northern Africa, the Middle East,
Western and Central Asia, and Southeast Asia.  Presently, Indonesia has
more Muslims than any other country in the world.*  
 *             
 The Western ideals of the individual and the recognition of the
necessity of human laws to supplement religious edicts directly conflict
with many tenets of Eastern theologies and philosophies.  The importance
of the “collective” and “unity” with other lives are foundational
elements of Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism, Shinto, and Islam.  In
analyzing current political issues in Asia and determining available
options for international relations with the region, one should have a
fundamental understanding of the formative religions in order to
ascertain feasible options for action and collabor-ation.*
