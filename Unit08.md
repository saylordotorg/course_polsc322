**Unit 8: Politics and Government in North and South Korea,
1953-Present** <span id="8"></span> 
*In this unit, you will examine the development of governments and
political systems in North and South Korea following the ceasefire
agreement in 1953.  North Korea has remained under the control of the
Communist Party, led by the Kim family.  South Korea has a three-branch,
presidential system of government, similar to that of the United
States.*  
  
 *Reunification of North and South Korea into one country remains the
dream of many Korean families separated by the 38<sup>th</sup>
parallel.  While South Korea has become a major economic power in recent
decades, North Korea stuggles due to its corrupt, omnipotent leaders,
widespread famine, and disease.*
