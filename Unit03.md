**Unit 3: The Impact of Western Imperialism on Government and Politics
in East Asia During the 16th to Mid-20th Centuries** <span
id="3"></span> 
*During the 16<sup>th</sup> century, European explorers ventured into
East Asia, seeking raw materials to exploit through industrialization
and new markets for finished goods.  The next four centuries saw vast
colonialization of Asia, as well as Africa. *  
  
 *The French focused their colonial developments in the region of
Indochina (Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos).  The Spanish focused on the
Philippines and Guam.  The Dutch focused on treaty ports in China
(Xiamen and Fujian) as well as Indonesia. The British were deeply
entrenched in Central Asia (India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and the
Arabian Peninsula), but also had many treaty ports in China, in addition
to the islands of Hong Kong and Singapore. The Germans and Italians had
little colonial involvement in Asia, save for their treaty ports in
Shanghai and Tianjin, China. The Americans were relative latecomers to
the imperialism game – they had treaty ports in China and Japan, and
then reaped the spoils of victory in the Spanish-American War by gaining
control of Guam and the Philippines from Spain in 1898.  The ancient
kingdom of Siam (Thailand) was able to remain autonomous through the
ceding of border territories to French colonialists.  The Japanese were
forced by the Americans to allow “treaty ports,” but were a colonial
power themselves, annexing Korea as a colony in 1910. *  
  
 *Colonialism laid the foundation for World War II and the Communist
Revolution in China, as well as several Cold War conflicts in the
region. Distrust of Westerners and the Japanese because of abuses that
occurred during the colonial era in Asia continues to impact foreign
relations and trade in the region today.*
