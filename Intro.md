This course will introduce you to the international relations of the
Asia-Pacific region.  In political science, the “Asia-Pacific” region is
generally limited to those parts of Asia east of India, and for the
purposes of this course, will include Northeast (China, Japan, Taiwan,
and the two Koreas) and Southeast Asia (Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia,
Laos, Indonesia, Singapore, and the Philippines).  Countries in South
and Southwest Asia, such as the Gulf States, India, Afghanistan, and
Pakistan, will not be covered, nor will the Commonwealth countries of
Australia and New Zealand.  Globalization, economic ties, national
security issues, and politico-military alliances with the U.S. make an
understanding of this region important to any political science student
or participant in American government. The political systems of Asia
have a much longer history (dating back nearly 5,000 years) than do the
systems you may be accustomed to studying in the West.  The general
philosophical outlooks of the Asian population have likewise been molded
through societal and historical forces very different from those of the
West.  As such, this course will begin with an examination of the
differences between Eastern and Western thought and a discussion of how
culture and philosophy impact government and politics. The next few
sections of the course will address government and politics in Asia by
examining pre-colonial systems of government, Western imperialism and
colonial governments, national liberation movements, and proxy wars
fought by the Superpowers through supporting selected political regimes
in the region during the era of the Cold War.  The course will conclude
with a survey of political systems and issues in Northeast and Southeast
Asia during the past two decades. Please note that this course will
apply concepts from international relations theory where appropriate. 
Because international relations theory developed out of the Western
European experience, scholars debate how well international relations
theory applies to regions other than Western Europe, but we will attempt
it here with that caveat in mind.  The Asia-Pacific region is of
particular interest in current international relations scholarship as it
is home to China, which is widely considered a potential challenger to
U.S. global hegemony.  The Asia-Pacific has also given rise to several
of the U.S.’s major security concerns: financial support of the U.S.
economy by China and Japan through the purchase of U.S. government debt
securities, conflict with China over Taiwan, North Korea’s nuclear
weapons program, separatist movements in several of the smaller Pacific
Rim nations, and the growth and support of transnational terrorism
within the region.

### Course Information

Welcome to POLSC322.  Below, please find general information on the
course and its requirements.

**Course Designer**: Dr. Sharon Jumper

**Primary Resources: **This course is composed of a range of different
free, online materials.  However, the course makes primary use of the
following:

-   Columbia University’s *[Asia for
    Educators](http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/)* website.
-   YouTube: day50192A: Mike Day’s “Comparative Religions” video clips.
-   Lionel Giles’ translation of Sun Tzu’s [*The Art of
    War*](http://www.chinapage.com/sunzi-e.html)*.*

**Requirements for Completion: **In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.
 Pay special attention to Units 1 and 2, as it is important to
understand the culture and history of the region in order to understand
the modern political systems in Asia that are presented in the latter
units.  You will also need to complete the Final Exam.

In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
the Final Exam.  Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you
complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.

**Time Commitment: **This course should take you a total of 110 hours
to complete.  Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists the amount
of time you are expected to spend on each subunit.  These time advisory
sections should help you plan your time accordingly.  It may be useful
to take a look at these time advisories and to determine how much time
you have over the next few weeks to complete each unit and then set
goals for yourself.  For example, Unit 1 should take you 12 hours.
 Perhaps you can sit down with your calendar and decide to
complete subunits 1.1 and 1.2 (a total of 4 hours) on Monday night,
subunit 1.3 (a total of 2 hours) on Tuesday night, etc.

**Tips/Suggestions:**  Asian history is much longer than the history of
Western nations you have studied, so it is important to keep this in
mind as you progress through the materials. The influence of Eastern
religions has permeated government, culture, and social mores in Asia,
and these influences may be difficult to understand as a Westerner.
 Keep in mind that generally speaking, Eastern religions have a much
more collective orientation than do Judaism and Christianity, and
collectivism is a common theme throughout Asian politics and governance.
