**Unit 10: Politics and Government in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos,
1975-Present** <span id="10"></span> 
*In this unit, you will examine the politics and government in Vietnam,
Cambodia, and Laos since the U.S. military departed Saigon in 1975.  In
Vietnam, the previously divided country was reunited under communist
rule. As the Cold War ended and both China and Russia undertook
capitalist reforms within their own nations, Vietnam was largely left to
its own devices by these communist Superpowers. In the past decade,
Vietnam has normalized relations with the West and improved its economy
through increased industrial output. *  
 *             
 Cambodia suffered tremendously following the U.S. withdrawal from the
region.  Following a civil war from 1975-1979, the Khmer Rouge seized
power and killed over two million Cambodians after they came to power.
In 1985, the country established a constitutional monarchy, with a King
as figurative Head of State, and a Prime Minister who runs to country,
similar to what we see in the United Kingdom. Since then, the country
has been seeking economic recovery through increased agricultural
production and tourism.*  
 *             
 Communist revolutionaries seized control of Laos in 1975, and have
remained in power since that time. In recent years, Laos has developed
its mining, timber, and hydroelectric industries. Laos has long-standing
territorial and border disputes with Thailand.*
