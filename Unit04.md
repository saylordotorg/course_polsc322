**Unit 4: Politics of East Asia During World War II** <span
id="4"></span> 
*In this unit, you will study the impact of World War II on the
political systems and governance of East Asia.  The war began for Asia
much earlier than it did for Europe or the U.S. The Japanese invaded
Manchuria in 1931, and eventually expanded their power south and
westward through China and other parts of East Asia.*  
  
 *Most of the nations of East Asia aligned themselves with the Allied
Powers during World War II and fought against the Japanese.  Thailand
originally sided with the Japanese, but then switched sides towards the
end of the war. *  
  
 *There are many stories of atrocities committed in the Asian-Pacific
theatre of World War II.  It is estimated that over 25 million Chinese
died during Japan’s occupation of China between 1931 and 1945.  Emnity
resulting from the war still impacts politics in the region today.*
