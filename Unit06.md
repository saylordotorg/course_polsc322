**Unit 6: Politics and Government in Japan,1945-Present** <span
id="6"></span> 
*In this unit, we will examine politics and government in Japan
following World War II.  The U.S. occupied Japan for seven years
following the war.  The U.S. and its allied victors imposed restrictions
on the deploymment and maintenance of Japanese military forces.  These
restrictions included only permitting Japanese military forces for
self-defense on the mainland.  However, since the conclusion of the Cold
War, Japan has expanded its military operations and has become a major
economic power.  Although Japan still has an emperor, its government is
a parliamentary democracy.*
