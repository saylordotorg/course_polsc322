**Unit 9: Politics and Government in Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, and
The Philippines, 1945-Present** <span id="9"></span> 
*In this unit, you will examine the development of government and
politics in Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, and the Philippines. 
Thailand is the only one of these four nations that was not a colony, so
its path has been very different from the others.  Thailand has a
constitutional monarchy – while the King has little formal political
power, he remains highly respected by the people and is still a
political force of sorts.*  
 *             
 Singapore has had a relatively easy transition from British colony to
independent nation member of the British Commonwealth.  The Philippines
and Indonesia have had more difficult transitions during their
independence – civil wars, insurrection, and coup d’etats have
occurred.  Additionally, terrorism has gained a stronghold in both the
Philippines and Indonesia.*
