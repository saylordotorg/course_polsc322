**Unit 2: Government and Politics in East Asia from Ancient Times to the
16th Century** <span id="2"></span> 
*In this unit, you will learn about the political systems and
philosophies of countries of Eastern Asia from ancient times until the
era in which European and American colonial conquests began in Asia. 
Monarchist governments, some of which continued for more than a
millennium, characterized the pre-colonial period of government. 
Feudalism, rather than a monarchy, took root in Japan during this
era.*  
  
 *One of the great mysteries of history involves the disappearance of
civilizations in the Mekong region (Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos) during
the pre-colonial era.  During this era, there were many wars between
Japan and China, both of which used Korea as a “land bridge” to launch
attacks on one another.  This enmity among Japan, China, and Korea is
often invoked during contemporary disputes.  Influences from Southwest
Asia and India also manifested themselves during this era, through the
rule of maharajahs and the introduction of Buddhism and Islam into
Eastern Asia.*
