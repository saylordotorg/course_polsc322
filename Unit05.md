**Unit 5: Politics and Government in China, 1945-Present** <span
id="5"></span> 
*In this unit, you will learn about the development of government and
politics in China since the end of World War II.  A civil war occurred
in China following World War II, which resulted in Mao Tse Tung’s
Communist Party taking control of the country. *  
  
 *During the first decade of Mao’s leadership, millions of Chinese died
due to starvation and disease.  In response, Mao initiated the “Great
Leap Forward” to modernize industry and agricultural practices.*  
  
 *During the second decade of Mao’s leadership, the Chinese people began
to revolt, due to poor living conditions.  The Communist Party reacted
by implementing “The Cultural Revolution,” which imposed repressive
policies to squelch any dissent and instill fear in the citizenry.*  
  
 *Following the death of Mao, new leaders in China realized that if they
wanted to stay in power, they would have to institute political, social,
and economic reforms.  These reformers, led by Deng Xioaping,
implemented policies that gave rise to China’s current economic boom and
rising political status in the world.*
